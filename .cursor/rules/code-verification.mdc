# Code Verification Steps
Before committing changes or submitting code, always run these commands in order:

1. `cargo fmt` - Format the code according to Rust style guidelines
2. `cargo clippy` - Check for common mistakes and verify code quality
3. `cargo test` - Run the test cases to verify functionality

This ensures that the code is:
- Properly formatted
- Free of common programming errors
- Functionally correct according to test cases
